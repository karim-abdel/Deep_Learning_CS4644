This repository contains my solutions to the assignments for the Deep Learning course at Georgia Tech during Spring '23. 

Assignments

Assignment 1: Neural Networks from scratch

Assignment 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Assignment 3: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Network Visualization and Style Transfer

Assignment 4: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Worked with pre-trained language models for text generation and sentiment analysis.
Fine-tuned models on domain-specific datasets.

There are 4 different folders each one containing the code and a notebook. Moreover, there is a zip including the final submission
