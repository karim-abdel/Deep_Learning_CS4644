# CS 4464/7643 Deep Learning HW3 Local Environment Setup

To run the notebook locally, we will give a recommended setup using miniforge and VSCode.

First, [install miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#install) or any other conda installation you are comfortable with.

Then, [install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with the [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).

Finally, open the **root homework folder** with VS Code and follow the remaining directions the 
Setup section within `main.ipynb`.

If you want to run anything within your command line, ensure that you have run `conda activate dl_hw3` to change
to the correct conda environment.
